<!-- GCC toolchain documentation used for all Linux platforms to build NuttX -->

Execute the script below to install GCC 7-2017-q4:

```sh
pushd .
cd ~
wget https://armkeil.blob.core.windows.net/developer/Files/downloads/gnu-rm/7-2017q4/gcc-arm-none-eabi-7-2017-q4-major-linux.tar.bz2
tar -jxf gcc-arm-none-eabi-7-2017-q4-major-linux.tar.bz2
exportline="export PATH=$HOME/gcc-arm-none-eabi-7-2017-q4-major/bin:\$PATH"
if grep -Fxq "$exportline" ~/.bash_profile; then echo nothing to do ; else echo $exportline >> ~/.profile; fi
popd
```

Now restart your machine.

**If using Debian Linux, run this command:**

```sh
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt-get update
```

**Then install the 32 bit support libraries** (this might fail and can be skipped if running a 32 bit OS):

```sh
sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libgcc1:i386 libstdc++5:i386 libstdc++6:i386
sudo apt-get install gcc-7.3-base:i386 
```


**Troubleshooting**

Check the version by entering the following command:

```sh
arm-none-eabi-gcc --version
```

The output should be something similar to:

```sh
arm-none-eabi-gcc (GNU Tools for Arm Embedded Processors 7-2017-q4-major) 7.2.1 20170904 (release) [ARM/embedded-7-branch revision 255204]
Copyright (C) 2017 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO

```

If you get the following output, make sure you have the 32bit libs installed properly as described in the installation steps:

```sh
arm-none-eabi-gcc --version
arm-none-eabi-gcc: No such file or directory
```
